================================================================================
NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE SETUP
================================================================================

1. Install SystemD Service (REQUIRED):
   $ sudo /home/paul/security-scanner/install.sh

   This will:
   - Install systemd service and timer
   - Enable automatic scanning
   - Schedule first scan

2. Fix Email Authentication (RECOMMENDED):
   The Gmail App Password needs to be updated.
   
   See: /home/paul/security-scanner/EMAIL_SETUP.md
   
   Quick fix:
   a) Generate new Gmail App Password at:
      https://myaccount.google.com/security
   b) Update ~/.msmtprc with new password
   c) Test: echo "test" | msmtp nyepaul@gmail.com

3. Test Manual Scan (OPTIONAL):
   $ /home/paul/security-scanner/security-scan.sh

   View the generated report:
   $ firefox /home/paul/security-scanner/reports/security_report_*.html

================================================================================
SCHEDULED EXECUTION
================================================================================

Default Schedule:
  - Every Sunday at 2:00 AM (±30 min random delay)
  - 15 minutes after system boot
  - Catches up missed scans if system was off

Email Recipient:
  - nyepaul@gmail.com

Report Storage:
  - Local: /home/paul/security-scanner/reports/
  - Email: Sent after each scan (once email is fixed)

================================================================================
USEFUL COMMANDS
================================================================================

Run Scan Now:
  $ /home/paul/security-scanner/security-scan.sh
  OR
  $ sudo systemctl start security-scanner.service

Check Next Scheduled Scan:
  $ systemctl list-timers security-scanner.timer

View Scan Logs:
  $ journalctl -u security-scanner.service -f
  $ tail -f /home/paul/security-scanner/logs/scan_*.log

View Latest Report:
  $ ls -lt /home/paul/security-scanner/reports/ | head -2
  $ firefox $(ls -t /home/paul/security-scanner/reports/*.html | head -1)

Check Timer Status:
  $ systemctl status security-scanner.timer

Stop Automated Scans:
  $ sudo systemctl stop security-scanner.timer
  $ sudo systemctl disable security-scanner.timer

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

1. Email Configuration:
   - The existing Gmail App Password in ~/.msmtprc appears to be expired
   - Reports are STILL saved locally even if email fails
   - Follow EMAIL_SETUP.md to fix email delivery

2. Security Considerations:
   - Scanner runs as user 'paul' (not root)
   - Resource limits prevent excessive CPU/memory usage
   - All scan data stored in user's home directory
   - No external data transmission except email reports

3. Customization:
   - Edit security-scanner.timer to change scan frequency
   - Modify EMAIL_RECIPIENT in security-scan.sh to change recipient
   - Add custom modules in modules/ directory
   - See README.md for detailed customization options

4. Documentation:
   - Complete guide: /home/paul/security-scanner/README.md
   - Email setup: /home/paul/security-scanner/EMAIL_SETUP.md
